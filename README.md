# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of Project
We were hired by V. Isualize to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, youâ€™ll create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. The purpose of our analysis is to create a summary dataframe for each city type. We will first get the total number of drivers,rides and fares by city type. Then we will calculate our average fare per ride and driver.
